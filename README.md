# openCL_DNN
A vanilla prototype of using openCL to implement a simple DNN without predict and optimization.

This DNN structure with 3 hidden layers which includes softmax.

This version include a serial version of DNN which includes training and prediction.

An openCL version is implemented with training process only but not prediction part. And also, havent check that the result is correct or not, and maybe full of bug, and also with a naive matrix-matrix multiplication without any optimization.
