# openCL_DNN
A vanilla prototype of using openCL to implement a simple DNN without predict and optimization.

This DNN structure with 3 hidden layers which includes softmax.

This version include a serial version of DNN which includes training and prediction.

An openCL version is implemented with training process but havent in predict.
